Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: In my opinion, 100 simulations are completely wrong.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 1000000 simulations are enough.
