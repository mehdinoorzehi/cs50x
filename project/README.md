Greetings and don't be tired, my dear friends. I am Mehdi Noorzahi, a student of CS50 Harvard, and this is my project. I did this project alone for my university, where it received a good grade. Now, I am excited to showcase it here and hoping for a similar positive outcome.

In this project, I utilized Python to create a university registration website simulator with a very attractive design. The simulation takes place in the command line interface and incorporates emojis to enhance the visual appeal. The primary objective of the project is to facilitate registrations for students, teachers, and employees.

One of the key features of the simulator is the ability for students to register and select their desired courses. These courses are predefined by the employees, ensuring a streamlined registration process. By offering this functionality, the project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for managing university registrations.

To store and manage all the necessary information, I opted for a file-based approach rather than using a database. This decision allows for efficient data handling and retrieval while maintaining simplicity in the project structure.

To achieve the desired functionality, I developed a set of classes that represent various entities within the registration system. These classes are interconnected, enabling smooth communication and data flow between different components. Additionally, I implemented several functions that play a crucial role in the overall system operation. In a video presentation, I demonstrated the functionality and usage of these classes and functions, providing a comprehensive overview of the project.

Security is a top priority in the project. To ensure authorized access, I incorporated a username and password section into the registration process. This provides an additional layer of protection and safeguards sensitive information.

The project also features a visually appealing menu with a unique design. I took great care in crafting an attractive layout that enhances the user experience. The menu serves as a central hub for navigation and interaction with different parts of the registration system.

In conclusion, I sincerely hope that my project meets the required standards and is well-received. I am immensely grateful to the contributors of this valuable and useful course, as their guidance and support have been instrumental in my project's development. It is worth mentioning that apart from this project, I am actively engaged in other courses, which further enriches my academic journey and brings me great joy and satisfaction.
